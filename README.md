# Terminal-Raven-Claw-RPG-Game
I had the idea to learn a new script lang.  And thats how Raven Claw comes to live: RC is a text based RPG Adventure by using Tilix, dialog, jq, fzf, and bash. The game is based on a mixture of game features: Crafting, Shops, etc. The heart is gonna be some algorythm which provides an endless game without script writing
